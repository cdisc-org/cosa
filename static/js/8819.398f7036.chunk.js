With studies requiring dozens or even hundreds of tables, the required customization and subsequent QC can be time consuming and resource intensive. These tables also must be pre-specified (without data) to serve as a \'mock\' representation of the final output.\\nTo address the need for improved efficiency in this area, a new industry data standard is on the horizon: unformatted analysis results data (ARD). With the ARD, there is a clear separation of analysis and reporting; this means that QC can be focused on the values themselves and the data is agnostic to the final output. Further, a consistent input data structure presents the opportunity to create more flexible and powerful tools for table creation.","solution":"The {tfrmt} R package is a table formatting framework that provides the means to flexibly design and build mock results summaries before Biostatistics receives our first cut of data. The code to generate the mock tables can then be reused at the point of reporting, dramatically reducing the workload for our Programming team as we reach key milestones. For our many standard results tables, this process can be further simplified via the use of formatting templates, which can be reused and easily updated for future studies. Additional benefits of {tfrmt} are its future-readiness and its enablement of a \'multilingual\' programming culture. {tfrmt} expects that analyses are performed in advance; this puts us ahead of the curve with respect to new, anticipated standards for intermediate results data. Prior to creating the final table, Statisticians and Programmers can summarize and model the data using tools most familiar to them, which increases efficiencies.","openSourceConsiderations":"This was open sourced as a way of helping the transition to ARDs and to allow for the creation of table templates that can be used across industry.
