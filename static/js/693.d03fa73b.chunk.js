Furthermore, products that allow interactive exploration of ADaM data primarily are proprietary and do not allow the code that generated the interactive visualization, limiting its use for reproducibility.","solution":"{tidyCDISC} is an application designed with the shiny package in R that allows a user to import ADaM data, create tables using a drag-and-drop interface, figures, and patient profiles. The code that generated the drag-and-drop table can then be exported as an R script, capable of running independently from the shiny program.\\n#### List of {tidyCDISC} presentations:\\n* [Phuse single day event](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFGkHrV0WbY&t=454s)\\n* [R/Medicine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeHSjw-vU3U&t=103s)\\n* [R in Pharma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzcMsNr_c0E)\\n* [tidyCDISC Youtube Channel](https://bit.ly/tidyCDISC_demo_recording)\\n* [Appsilon Shiny Conference 2022](https://bit.ly/shinyconf)","openSourceConsiderations":"Pharmaceutical organizations must work in tandem to produce thoroughly tested, high-valued tools within the industry to appease regulatory agencies. As such, the {tidyCDISC} project was open sourced to offer an opportunity for greater collaboration and improvement of the clinical data exploration & reporting pipeline.","maintenanceModel":"Issues are collected through our GitHub repo and is the quickest way to garner attention from a {tidyCDISC} developer for bug fixes and maintenance.","projectSize":"X-Large. {tidyCDISC} is a larger shiny app with various modules, including some custom JavaScript","contributors":"All contributors are welcome! It\u2019s best if contributors have a working knowledge of shiny apps designed with the golem R-package. Also, we have a number of developer guides to help get them started: https://biogen-inc.github.io/tidyCDISC/articles/index.html. Contributors must also comply with our code of conduct: https://biogen-inc.github.io/tidyCDISC/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.html","users":"It would be helpful to be familiar with clinical data & ADaM standards","preRequisites":"CDISC Pilot data is baked into the application for demonstration purposes but if the user aims to use their own data, a CDISC compliant ADSL data is required (at a  minimum).","projectServiceOptions":"Our goal would be similar to other pharma projects (admiral, etc.): a community would form around it to guide it\u2019s evolution overtime","sponsors":"It was initially developed at Biogen, Inc., but there are now no other sources of funding","goalsObjectives":"The goal is to have {tidyCDISC} used in clinical trial environments and collect feedback as to what is effective and what can be done to enhance operating efficiency & app function.","communications":"As of now communications can be seen in GitHub issues, PRs, and changelog releases. We also have a blog (https://biogen-inc.github.io/tidyCDISC/articles/Blog.html) to publish updates on our documentation site. Thinking long term, we may transition to a pharmaverse slack group (stay tuned).","additonalInformation":"{tidyCDISC} developers are currently working towards a CRAN release and many other useful features detailed in our GitHub issues. Stay tuned!"}}')}}]);
