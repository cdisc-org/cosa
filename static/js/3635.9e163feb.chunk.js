And once they are made available, the programmer writes the SAS code to generate the analysis datasets and TFLs. And in most companies, the generation of analysis deliverables is very manual (sometimes with macros or re-using code).\\nCDISC 360 proof of concept (POC) project demonstrated end-to-end automation of study specification, data processing and analysis using a metadata-driven approach. As a result, CDISC is working on adding a conceptual layer to the analysis standards (e.g., CDISC Analysis Results Standards) and are developing a Safety User Guide.\\nThere is a need of a tool that can leverage available CDISC analysis results standards/templates and accelerate generation of the TFL shells and support metadata-driven automation in development of ADaM and TFLs.","solution":"Build an open-source TFL designer (technology stack: TBD) that can ingest available standards/templates from the CDISC library to design study-specific analysis output display (TFL shell) and in parallel generate machine-readable metadata that will facilitate generation of analysis dataset as well as the output of interest (TFL).\\nIndustry wide collaboration is required to develop a tool that is widely accepted and used by the stakeholders. This project will help build up the community to work on a solution that works for all without disrupting the current workflows.","openSourceConsiderations":"* By the people, for the people\\n* Open-source offering\\n* Integrate with the current industry workflow.\\n* Integrate with CDISC library and future updates.\\n* In line with the CDISC vision of concept-based standards\\n* Professional services offering for Sponsor-specific implementation/ customization.","maintenanceModel":"","projectSize":"","contributors":"","users":"Support from Microsoft, CDISC (COSA), PHUSE, and 3 large Sponsor companies\\n* Contributors\\n* Thought leaders in the space.\\n* Integrations with other CDISC projects (CDISC Library, Analysis Results Standards, Safety User Guide, and other open-source projects).","preRequisites":"","projectServiceOptions":"","sponsors":"* Funding required for 2-3 paid developers (core team to initiate the project or continue contributing).\\n* Project Maintainers (responsible for code governance etc.)\\n* Community Manager\\n* Evangelist\\n* Contributors to Community (not paid)\\n* Infrastructure/services\\n* Marketing","goalsObjectives":"* Size of community\\n* Number of contributors\\n* Usage  of such tool by the  Biometrics team in the industry\\n* Need for customization to fit the Sponsor/Study specific requirements","communications":"Social media announcement, approval from COSA, and active recruitment\\n* Seek funding/grants.\\n* Dedicated developers to help build the tool.\\n* Development of MVP\\n* CDISC and PHUSE Conferences\\n* White papers, Blog post\\n* Weekly meetings","additonalInformation":""}}')}}]);
