The inherent flexibility provided by the standards supports a broad range of implementations, but that flexibility also allows for inconsistencies that makes automation scaling difficult. Furthermore, the lack of end-to-end awareness and use of the CDISC standards (e.g. for writing documents such as the protocol and clinical study reports) prohibits efficient end-to-end automation and introduces discrepancies between different presentations of the study specifications, such as e.g. discrepancies in terminology used between protocol, CRF and SDTM datasets.       ","solution":"The OpenStudyBuilder is a new approach to working with studies that once fully implemented will drive end-to-end consistency and more efficient processes - all the way from protocol development and CRF design - to creation of datasets, analysis, reporting, submission to health authorities and public disclosure of study information following standards from CDISC, TransCelerate and others. \\n\\nThe OpenStudyBuilder consists of: \\n\\n* The OpenStudyBuilder app (web-based user interface) \\n* The clinical Metadata Repository and Study Definition Repository \\n* The API layer (allowing interoperability with other systems) \\n* The integrations to source and target systems ","openSourceConsiderations":"This challenge cannot be solved by CDISC, any vendors or any pharma companies alone. The purpose of this project as an open-source project is therefore to engage interested stakeholders in the CDISC community to collaborate in funding, implementing, and applying this solution approach in our clinical development activities. We thereby hope the learnings and best practices can be shared in the community and be used in the coming development of the standard concepts, data models and API specifications. \\n\\nThe tool consists of different components coming along with the MIT and GPLv3 license. The full license documentation is available on the GitLab page. ","maintenanceModel":"Currently Novo Nordisk is responsible for project governance and system maintenance. As a mid-term solution a community should be built up, which can take over the maintenance to support various companies best.","projectSize":"This XL project has been developed over multiple years by various developers.","contributors":"Contributions are much appreciated. For example, the following contributions are very welcome: \\n\\n* Join discussion and user group\\n* Feature and bug reporting \\n* Documentation / Training / Explanation contributions\\n* Coding contribution directly or through vendors\\n* Additional components as standalone components or under this project\u2019s umbrella","userDetails":"Depending on the usage, different knowledge would be recommended. As a study designer you can set up a study very intuitively using the OpenStudyBuilder and the available online help. \\n\\nAs a standards developer maintaining the concept-based data standards within the library areas more comprehensive training and use of online documentation is needed. \\n\\nWhen additional custom standards and models should be included into the biomedical concept model, linked data knowledge as well as knowledge about the Neo4j database would be recommended. This will be related to system maintenance. ","preRequisites":"The current implementation required CDISC library access to access CDISC standards. Additionally, a Neo4j database enterprise license is recommended for the database. Furthermore, a server running the web applications and API services is required. A docker-environment is provided coming along with pre-set test data.","sponsors":"The project is currently funded by Novo Nordisk. Additional pharma companies that would be interested in funding additional development, modules or connected tools are very appreciated and welcome. ","goalsObjectives":"The vision and business benefit of the solution is to support digitalisation in clinical development by: \\n\\n* Enabling seamless interoperability and cross-functional end-to-end study-team collaboration. \\n* Centrally storing study design data for multiple down-stream usages (\u2018one source of truth\u2019). \\n* Saving time and resources and minimising errors and discrepancies by enabling an end-to-end process based on shared standards, templates and study design data with the community to facilitate faster reporting and submissions. \\n* Enabling insights via enhanced search and explore. \\n* Implementing a sustainable model for maintenance and integrations. \\n* Basing the solution on industry standards with the objective to drive this as an open-source collaboration.

The project is continuously presented at various events, please checkout the events page for upcoming plans.
