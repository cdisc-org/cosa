An emerging Industry best practice is to use Conformance Rules on an ongoing basis, throughout the study, to keep the data as close to submission ready as possible and to ensure quality in all data exchange scenarios.\\n\\nCurrent CDISC Conformance Rules need to be expressed in a common specification to be loaded to the CDISC Library.","solution":"An easy to use rule editor is required to allow data scientists to author conformance rules in YAML, check the rule against the Conformance Rule Schema standard, test the rule against test data and then publish the rule.","openSourceConsiderations":"The Rule Editor is being released as OSS in order to allow as many in our industry to utilize the new Conformance Rule Schema standard when writing conformance rules. While the schema is a standard and CDISC IP, CDISC\'s desire is that the functionality of the Rule Editor will grow with the needs of the industry.","maintenanceModel":"Issues will be reported through GitHub.","projectSize":"This is considered a small-medium project.","contributors":"In addition to agreeing with the CDISC and COSA codes of conduct, the contributors will submit issues and pull requests through GitHub.","users":"Users of the Rule Editor must:\\n- have basic knowledge of YAML\\n- understand the Rule Schema\\n- understand how to create test data\\n- have an understanding of the standard(s) for which they are writing rules","preRequisites":"Running the Rule Editor requires:\\n- an Azure Static Web App instance (Hosted or Local)\\n- an Azure Cosmos DB instance (Hosted or Emulated locally).","projectServiceOptions":"There are no service options for the Rule Editor.","sponsors":"The Rule Editor is not a sponsored project.","goalsObjectives":"The Rule Editor has been created to author conformance rules and it and the schema will continue to mature as more rules are authored.  The GitHub issues will maintain additional objectives the community wants for the Rule Editor.","communications":"The Rule Editor Community can utilize the open CORE Slack channel.","additonalInformation":""}}')}}]);
