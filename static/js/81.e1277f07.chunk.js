The inherent flexibility provided by the standards supports a broad range of implementations, but that flexibility also allows for inconsistencies that makes automation scaling difficult. Furthermore, the lack of end-to-end awareness and use of the CDISC standards (e.g. for writing documents such as the protocol and clinical study reports) prohibits efficient end-to-end automation and introduces discrepancies between different presentations of the study specifications, such as e.g. discrepancies in terminology used between protocol, CRF and SDTM datasets.       \\n\\nThe vision is to solve this problem by implementing standards as linked metadata with a conceptual foundation providing the additional semantics needed to support metadata driven-automation across the end-to-end clinical research data lifecycle \u2013 as illustrated by the CDISC 360 PoC project (see more at [https://www.cdisc.org/cdisc-360](https://www.cdisc.org/cdisc-360)).","solution":"The OpenStudyBuilder is a new approach to working with studies that once fully implemented will drive end-to-end consistency and more efficient processes - all the way from protocol development and CRF design - to creation of datasets, analysis, reporting, submission to health authorities and public disclosure of study information.\\n\\nThe OpenStudyBuilder contains:\\n\\n* Standards and templates used for study specification\\n* Individual versioning of standard elements in the library \\n* Real-time team collaboration around study design by study team\\n* Central storage of study design data for multiple down-stream usages (\u2018one source of truth\u2019)\\n* Versioning and full audit trail of study definitions\\n\\nThe OpenStudyBuilder will cover the following study specification elements:\\n\\n* Study purpose (objectives, endpoints, estimands)\\n* Population (disease area, indication, sex, age, etc)\\n* Selection criteria (eligibility, randomisation, dosing, treatment discontinuation, etc)\\n* Study type (interventional, observational, etc)\\n* Study design (randomisation, blinding, arms, etc)\\n* Interventions (drug, dose, route, devise, lifestyle interventions, etc.)\\n* Visit schedule (naming, timing, type, windows)\\n* Activities and assessments (what, how, when)\\n* All the terminology and syntax standards to follow\\n* Complete audit trail of what has changed over time\\n    \\nThe OpenStudyBuilder consists of:\\n\\n* The OpenStudyBuilder app (web-based user interface)\\n* The new clinical Metadata Repository (central repository for all study specification data)\\n* The API layer (allowing interoperability with other systems)\\n* The integrations to source and target systems\\n    \\nThe conceptual design for the OpenStudyBuilder system with connected system integrations is illustrated in the following diagram.\\n\\n![Diagram of conceptual design](https://gitlab.com/Novo-Nordisk/nn-public/openstudybuilder/project-description/-/raw/main/img/studyBuilderDesign.png)\\n\\n* **OpenStudyBuilder** online documentation for the OpenStudyBuilder solution including introduction, user guides, system documentation and data model documentation.\\n* **OpenStudyBuilder App** Vuetify based Web application with the UI for creating the study definition specification.\\n* **Protocol Metadata Word add-in** holding the Protocol Template and import features of the structured study specification metadata that relates to the protocol content.\\n* **Up-stream integrations** to clinical systems like CTMS, Trial Supplies, EDC, Study Registries, etc.\\n* **Down-stream integrations** to clinical data systems for SDTM, ADaM, analysis and reporting.\\n* **Explore data** FAIR based study search and explore tool utilising the OpenStudyBuilder metadata with reference to systems holding study data.\\n* **OpenStudyBuilder API** and Standards Library API Python based web application based on FAST API framework supporting all CRUD actions to the database, access control, versioning, workflows and data integrity rules.\\n* **Integration Service** Integration to UNIX based Statistical Computing Environment (SCE) with SAS and R.\\n* **Clinical MDR** Neo4j linked graph database and data model supporting the library standards, study definitions including fine granularity of versioning, audit trail, workflows and access control.\\n* **Standards Management** Integrated into the OpenStudyBuilder App as the Library module managing concepts, dictionaries, code lists, syntax templates, project and TA standards.","openSourceConsiderations":"This challenge cannot be solved by CDISC, any vendors or any pharma companies alone. The purpose of this project as an open-source project is therefore to engage interested stakeholders in the CDISC community to collaborate in funding, implementing, and applying this solution approach in our clinical development activities. We thereby hope the learnings and best practices can be shared in the community and be used in the coming development of the standard concepts, data models and API specifications.\\n\\nThe OpenStudyBuilder system component architecture including software components and packages are illustrated in the following diagram.\\n\\n![Diagram of component design](https://gitlab.com/Novo-Nordisk/nn-public/openstudybuilder/project-description/-/raw/main/img/studyBuilderComponents.png)\\n\\n**Disclaimer:** The following licenses are planned to be used.

As a study designer you can set up a study very intuitively using the OpenStudyBuilder and the available online help.\\n\\nAs a standards developer maintaining the concept-based data standards within the library areas more comprehensive training and use of online documentation is needed. \\n\\nWhen additional custom standards and models should be included into the biomedical concept model, linked data knowledge as well as knowledge about the Neo4j database would be recommended. This will be related to system maintenance. ","preRequisites":"The current implementation required CDISC library access to access CDISC standards, a Neo4j database license for the database and a set of servers where the web applications and API services can run.\\n\\nAccess to the open-source code will be via a public accessible GitLab repository. A link to this repository will be provided when available.\\n\\nNovo Nordisk is using a full containerised DevOps pipeline running in Azure where everything is hosted in the cloud. We will provide guidance on how a similar dedicated cloud-based environment can be made for stakeholders looking for a similar environment.\\n\\nAccess to a shared or dedicated cloud-based evaluation environment can be provided by Neo4j free of charge. More information on various options will be shared later.\\n\\nIt is also possible to run the full system on a local desktop environment or on an individual cloud subscription on any of the main cloud providers. Instructions on how this can be done is made within the readme files in the Git repositories.\\n\\nThe different components can also be used independently due to the modular implementation and API usages.","sponsors":"The project is currently funded by Novo Nordisk. Additional pharma companies that would be interested in funding additional development, modules or connected tools are very appreciated and welcome.","goalsObjectives":"The vision and business benefit of the solution is to support digitalisation in clinical development by:\\n\\n* Enabling seamless interoperability and cross-functional end-to-end study-team collaboration.\\n* Centrally storing study design data for multiple down-stream usages (\u2018one source of truth\u2019).\\n* Saving time and resources and minimising errors and discrepancies by enabling an end-to-end process based on shared standards, templates and study design data with the community to facilitate faster reporting and submissions.\\n* Enabling insights via enhanced search and explore.\\n* Implementing a sustainable model for maintenance and integrations.\\n* Basing the solution on industry standards with the objective to drive this as an open-source collaboration.\\n    \\n**End-to-end process support**\\n\\nThe end-to-end process is supported by the use of new concept-based data standards from protocol set-up, study specification, clinical systems setup, and preparation of submission data deliverable. The OpenStudyBuilder application supports study specification tasks for Trial Management, Clinical Reporting, Data Management and Biostatistics.\\n\\n**Benefits**\\n\\nThe benefits are to manage master data and definitions for CDISC Data Standards, other industry standards and internal standards. Furthermore, the clinical system set-up and end-to-end data integrations with higher degree of automation from study outline to submission are supported.\\n\\n**Innovation**\\n\\nA modern graph database is used to link between related elements within and across standards (code lists) and studies. A transparent API-based architecture ensures simple system integration and allows for additional expandsion via dedicated applications. A simple and intuitive user interface is used which is based on a state-of-the-art modern application framework.\\n\\n**Modular implementation**\\n\\nThe tool and interface design specifically supports partial components. A full-stack operational flow is not required. It is possible to use only parts of the tool set. The design allows for system replacements, for example when a component should be replaced with another technology considering the API interfaces. According to the design, additional tools and functionalities can be implemented using and providing APIs.","communications":"A community homepage will be set up for up-to-date information about the project. The project is presented at various conferences. Additional presentations, webinars, discussion, workshops and training sessions are planned. Please also join the Slack channel for discussions or use the OpenStudyBuilder@gmail.com community mail.","additonalInformation":"**Background**\\n\\nThis solution is based on a legacy bespoke MDR system at Novo Nordisk, and one of the goals for Novo Nordisk is to ensure that our current sponsor-defined data standards and portfolio of study definitions can be migrated into the new MDR and OpenStudyBuilder system.\\n\\nThe new solution design for the OpenStudyBuilder is deeply inspired by the CDISC 360 PoC project as well as the TransCelerate BioPharma Digital Data Flow (DDF) project. The goal for this project initiative is therefore to continue the collaboration with these initiatives and as the data model and API standards mature to ensure this open project solution becomes a compliant solution for these standards. Furthermore, additional community involvement is appreciated.\\n\\nCurrently the OpenStudyBuilder solution is only sponsored by Novo Nordisk. Novo Nordisk seeks additional stakeholders that would be interested in co-sponsoring this open-source project.\\n\\nThe first minimal viable product release is planned to be used by Novo Nordisk from Q3 2022."}}')}}]);
