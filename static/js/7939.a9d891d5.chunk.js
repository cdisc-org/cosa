However, there is currently no EDC and standards-agnostic solution available for creating SDTM datasets in R. This represents a significant gap in the pharmaceutical industry, as users lack a comprehensive toolkit for programming SDTM datasets in R.","solution":"{sdtm.oak} is an EDC (Electronic Data Capture systems) and Data Standard agnostic solution that enables the pharmaceutical programming community to develop CDISC (Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium) SDTM (Study Data Tabulation Model) datasets in R. The reusable algorithms concept in \u2018sdtm.oak\u2019 provides a framework for modular programming and also can potentially automate SDTM creation based on the standard SDTM spec.","openSourceConsiderations":"{sdtm.oak} is developed as an open-source solution under the Apache-2.0 license. This approach ensures transparency and enables the pharmaceutical programming community to contribute to the development of {sdtm.oak} and use it with ease.","maintenanceModel":"The project has a stable(main) and development branches. Issues can be reported either by GitHub. Issues in the stable version are fixed via hotfixes (the project uses git-flow approach), although de-facto the development version is far ahead of the stable version and now issues are fixed in the next development release.","projectSize":"Small Size T-shirt","contributors":"R developers, SDTM experts, Statistical programmers willing to contribute to Open-source initiative.","userDetails":"Study statistical programmers are primary users of the {sdtm.oak} R pacakge.","preRequisites":"None","projectServiceOptions":"None","sponsors":"COSA","goalsObjectives":"The goal of {sdtm.oak} is to create an EDC and standards-agnostic solution for generating SDTM datasets. This solution will also support CDISC\'s vision of connected standards, enabling the creation of SDTM datasets from standard eCRFs within the eCRF portal.","communications":"COSA Quarterly Webinar, Slack, Pharmaverse, Conferences","additonalInformation":""}}')}}]);
