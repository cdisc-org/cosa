The automation begins with upstream clinical systems, such as study builders, and continues with downstream clinical systems, such as electronic data capture systems (EDC) and clinical trial management systems (CTMS).\\nTransCelerate has collaborated to develop an open-source, vendor agnostic, study definition repository (SDR) reference implementation. The SDR\'s basis is a Unified Study Definitions Model (USDM), developed by CDISC, that standardizes the data model for protocol study definitions.\\nThe SDR reference implementation enables the format of information from a digitized protocol and other sources to be standardized and stored centrally. This allows the information to be passed to systems through application programming interfaces (APIs) used for study execution and data collection and reused throughout the clinical development lifecycle.\\nIn summary, DDF will combine data standards and a new technology to enable the flow of data across all systems involved in the design and execution of a clinical trial.","solution":"The SDR Reference Implementation enables the format of information from a digitized protocol and other sources to be standardized and stored centrally using the USDM. This allows the information to be passed to systems through application programming interfaces (APIs) used for study execution and data collection and reused throughout the clinical development lifecycle.\\nTo create a consistent, comprehensive, and structured representation of a study definition as described in text in clinical trial protocols, a Unified Study Definitions Model (\\"USDM\\") has been developed by CDISC, which contains both new and existing standards, and also provides common vocabulary, reusable designs, industry best practices, standards, and general implementation guidance for solution architects.\\nThe establishment of a Reference Implementation of the USDM standard represents a novel approach in the industry.\\nddf-sdr-platform : This repository holds the scripts written in Terraform for provisioning the underlying cloud hosted infrastructure to run the SDR platform, initially focused on the Microsoft Azure platform.\\nddf-sdr-api : This repository holds the ASP.NET Core api layer that comprises the core of the SDR platform\\nddf-sdr-ui : Several user interface features including search, view, and compare functionality was created to support the SDR. This repository holds the ASP.NET Core user interface layer code developed for these features","openSourceConsiderations":"The intent is to follow open-source principles wherever possible, to provide transparency and involvement in developing vendor-agnostic source code for connecting applications. Vendors can connect to the SDR reference implementation to test compatibility and use the code through open source licensing. Vendors can also take advantage of the interoperability functionality by deploying their own version in a cloud-based Software as a Service (SaaS) model or by building their own compliant SDR using a technology they choose. Sponsors can also create an SDR based on the SDR reference implementation for their own use, adding new functionality if desired, with the ability to contribute to further development of the SDR reference implementation.","maintenanceModel":"TransCelerate designed the study definitions repository (SDR) reference implementation governance model to support long-term sustainability. As the SDR reference implementation matures, governance will transition from the SDR reference implementation governance committee to a formal SDR reference implementation governance entity. This multi-stakeholder governance entity would be a separate organization whose stakeholders and objectives align with the concepts of interoperability and vendor agnostic access. The governance entity may require additional advisory committees or members to engage stakeholders, such as additional SSOs, like ICH M11 and HL7, technology solution providers, systems integrators, and others.","projectSize":"Using a T-shirt estimation the project size is extra-large. It has been developed since 2018 and has required significant investment of resources from TransCelerate, its member companies, CDISC, collaborating clinical systems vendors and others.","contributors":"Transcelerate, along with CDISC, Accenture, Microsoft, and other life sciences technology vendors have developed the Study Definitions Repository, based on the CDISC USDM standard, called the Study Definitions Repository (SDR) Reference Implementation.","users":"Roles impacted by DDF would be study managers, study protocol authors, medical writers, data management stakeholders concerned with ensuring consistent use of standards, clinical systems (IT) stakeholders, data managers, and clinicians primarily accountable for a study.","preRequisites":"DDF Materials have currently been developed only for the Azure DevOps environment. Our intention is that the solution will also be available for AWS and Google Cloud environments. \\nThe content in this repository assumes a good understanding of Azure concepts and services. The audience for this document is:\\nUser should have basic understanding of Terraform\\nUser should be aware of how to use Azure portal and basic understanding of Microsoft Azure Platform\\nUser should have basic understanding of GitHub Actions & Yaml","projectServiceOptions":"TransCelerate\xe2\u20ac\u2122s intention is to continue support of a core representation of the solution.  But, as a reference implementation, the DDF SDR could be supported by in-house teams or by third parties. ","sponsors":"TransCelerate Biopharma Inc.","goalsObjectives":"The main goal is to help developers use the USDM to improve end-to-end data flow and interoperability between various systems used in clinical trials to improve accuracy, minimize rework, and shorten development time lines.","communications":"DDF will be supported by an active communications program led by TransCelerate, including Social Media, youtube vidoes, public webinars, planned Connectathon(s). In addition, we will be creating a community supported via Github pages.","additonalInformation":"NA"}}')}}]);
