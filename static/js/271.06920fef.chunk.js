It can be challenging to develop Define-XML documents without auxiliary tools. There is a variety of tools, the most of which are based on tables (2D datasets or Excel). Goal of the Visual Define-XML Editor (VDE) is to simplify Define-XML editing for end users, by allowing them to focus on the content part of Define-XML Standard rather than on the technical aspects of it.","solution":"VDE is a WYSIWYG editor, which is intended to help develop dataset specifications as a Define-XML document from the very beginning of the dataset development process. It provides users an ability to create from Define-XML documents scratch and update existing documents. To help with the development it implements additional functionality, such as comments, linked codelists, import/export from Excel, XPT processing and etc. Currently the supported standards are Define-XML v3.0 and ARM v1.0 extension, as well as has integration with CDISC Library and implements CDISC Library and NCI/CDISC CT browsers.\\n\\n#### List of VDE presentations:\\n* [Visual Define-XML Editor](https://www.cdisc.org/system/files/all/event/restricted/2018_US/VisualDefine-XMLEditor_Kolosov.pdf) ([presentation](https://www.cdisc.org/system/files/all/event/restricted/2018_US/6C_VisualDefine-XMLEditor_Kolosov.pdf)), CDISC US Interchange 2018.\\n* [CDISC Webinar Visual Define-XML Editor](https://www.cdisc.org/events/webinar/cdisc-members-only-webinar-visual-define-xml-editor)\\n* [Creating ARM using Visual Define-XML Editor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIxXMsBxzws&t=1490s), Basel SDE 2020 and CDISC San-Diego User Group meeting","openSourceConsiderations":"VDE is published under AGPL-3.0 license. The main reason to create an open-source solution is to build of a community of users and have a transparency of the application. Also it provides an ability to build the application on platforms which are not available to me as a developer, e.g., mac os.\\nAnother reason to make it open-source is to develop more open-source packages related to our industry. Other open-source packages which are developed separately and used by VDE: [cla-wrapper](https://github.com/defineEditor/cla-wrapper), [xport-js](https://github.com/defineEditor/xport-js), [dataset-xml](https://github.com/defineEditor/dataset-xml).","maintenanceModel":"The project has a stable and development branches. Issues can be reported either by GitHub, e-mail or Telegram channel.\\nIssues in the stable version are fixed via hotfixes (the project uses git-flow approach), although de-facto the development version is far ahead of the stable version and now issues are fixed in the next development release.","projectSize":"Using a T-shirt estimation the project size is large. It has been developed\\nsince 2018 and a rough estimate is that it was spend more than a thousand hours\\non the project.","contributors":"Contributors must follow eslint rules specified in the .eslintrc file in the root folder.","userDetails":"The primary users of VDE are clinical programmers developing and reviewing\\ndataset specifications. It is expected that VDE users know Define-XML and ARM\\nstandards. There is no external training or documentation for the editor, help\\ndocumentation for non-standard functionality is available within the editor.","preRequisites":"The software is distributed for MS Windows (Windows 7 and above) and Linux systems. It was complied by one person on MacOS, but it is not supported on that platform as support requires to have a Mac.\\nThe project can be used as is and does not require any feedback or communication.","projectServiceOptions":"For the company where I am working, I performed in-house validation of the software.","sponsors":"N.A.","goalsObjectives":"The main goal is the usage by an industry, so that the community\\ncan provide user feedback and develop plugins (interface is not exposed in the\\ncurrent version).","communications":"The interaction with users is organized via a Telegram channel and\\na LinkedIn group. Where possible, it is promoted at conference.","additonalInformation":"N.A."}}')}}]);
