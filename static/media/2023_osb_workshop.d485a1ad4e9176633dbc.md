**Registration** is available [here](https://web.cvent.com/event/692520b3-5d88-48f1-b291-269010defffb/websitePage:645d57e4-75eb-4769-b2c0-f201a0bfc6ce).

<br/>

At this workshop we will dive into what Biomedical Concepts (BC) is, and how the can be applied within a MDR data standards repository and a SDR study definitions repository – illustrated within the OpenStudyBuilder (OSB) solution.

<br/>

We will as well relate to how BC’s are defined within COSMoS, DDF, d4k and other models. There will be a shared introduction followed by 4 breakout sessions, leading to a shared reflection and discussion on how we can support and bring these initiatives forward. The 4 breakout sessions are currently defined as:

- Setup BC's in OpenStudyBuilder Schedule of Activities (SoA) for a new study, run various queries to learn how BC's can be utilised
- Learn and understand the BC model in OSB versus the COSMoS, DDF, d4k and other models
- Create and curate OSB BC content via the OSB Library and NeoDash reports
- Mining BC’s from existing data sources like SDTM
