**{admiral} Hackathon Readout**

Learn the results from last month’s {admiral} Hackathon. The purpose of ADaM in R Asset Library {admiral} is to provide an open source, modularized toolbox that enables the pharmaceutical programming community to develop ADaM datasets in R. We’ll share lessons learned, outcomes, and upshots about developing open-source R packages for clinical reporting purposes.

**OAK - SDTM Automation: Call for Participants**

OAK-SDTM Automation is a new initiative to develop an open-source, metadata-driven SDTM automation solution that enables users to automate SDTM datasets in R. We’ll provide project overview (including vision and scope), describe the high-level roadmap, and show how you can volunteer to participate in this exciting project.

**COSA Biomedical Concept & OpenStudyBuilder Workshop**

Get a sneak peek into to our upcoming workshop that will take place at the CDISC Europe Interchange in Copenhagen.

The workshop will dive into what Biomedical Concepts (BC) are, and how they can be applied within a MDR data standards repository and a SDR study definitions repository – illustrated within the OpenStudyBuilder (OSB) solution.
