**{admiral} Hackathon Readout**

Learn the results from last month’s {admiral} Hackathon. The purpose of ADaM in R Asset Library {admiral} is to provide an open source, modularized toolbox that enables the pharmaceutical programming community to develop ADaM datasets in R. We’ll share lessons learned, outcomes, and upshots about developing open-source R packages for clinical reporting purposes.

**OAK - SDTM Automation: Call for Participants**

OAK-SDTM Automation is a new initiative to develop an open-source, metadata-driven SDTM automation solution that enables users to automate SDTM datasets in R. We’ll provide project overview (including vision and scope), describe the high-level roadmap, and show how you can volunteer to participate in this exciting project.

**COSA Biomedical Concept & OpenStudyBuilder Workshop**
