Join our {carver} team by registering to attend our meeting on 27 January. This meeting is to establish a group of collaborators to work on this project and plan out the next steps. What is {carver}? 

Clinical Analysis Reporting and Visualization Ensemble in R: An open-source (R) package in the COSA repository that aims to help generate common analysis reports – tables, listings, plots and interactive plots – for clinical review and regulatory submissions from ADaM data.
Currently the package contains about 10 common report types (adverse events, demographics etc) which can be generated through templates or interactively in a R Shiny application which is included within it.

Through collaboration with different players, we aim to expand the scope of reports – while it may not be exhaustive – to cover more requirements for submissions.
