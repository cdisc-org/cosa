Please join the COSA Collaboration Team in the OpenStudyBuilder-Hub. Our mission is to support the utilization and enhancement of the OpenStudyBuilder open-source tool. Here, we not only collect valuable feedback and use-cases but also actively run focused projects. Join us to drive innovation forward through both community engagement and project execution.

<br/>  

**Objective:** The primary goal of this meeting is to transition from the planning phase to the action phase for the Controlled Terminology focus group. We aim to summarize the collective insights and feedback from our community to address challenges, and information gaps, and implement needs. We will ask for contributions and assign volunteers for specific actions.
