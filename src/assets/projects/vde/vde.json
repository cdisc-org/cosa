    "problem": "Define-XML CDISC standard is an ODM-XML-based standard which is used to represent dataset specifications (e.g, ADaM or SDTM) in a normalized and machine readable data structure. It can be challenging to develop Define-XML documents without auxiliary tools. There is a variety of tools, the most of which are based on tables (2D datasets or Excel). Goal of the Visual Define-XML Editor (VDE) is to simplify Define-XML editing for end users, by allowing them to focus on the content part of Define-XML Standard rather than on the technical aspects of it.",
    "solution": "VDE is a WYSIWYG editor, which is intended to help develop dataset specifications as a Define-XML document from the very beginning of the dataset development process. It provides users an ability to create from Define-XML documents scratch and update existing documents. To help with the development it implements additional functionality, such as comments, linked codelists, import/export from Excel, XPT processing and etc. Currently the supported standards are Define-XML v3.0 and ARM v1.0 extension, as well as has integration with CDISC Library and implements CDISC Library and NCI/CDISC CT browsers.\n\n####List of VDE presentations:\n* [Visual Define-XML Editor](https://www.cdisc.org/system/files/all/event/restricted/2018_US/VisualDefine-XMLEditor_Kolosov.pdf) ([presentation](https://www.cdisc.org/system/files/all/event/restricted/2018_US/6C_VisualDefine-XMLEditor_Kolosov.pdf)), CDISC US Interchange 2018.\n* [CDISC Webinar Visual Define-XML Editor](https://www.cdisc.org/events/webinar/cdisc-members-only-webinar-visual-define-xml-editor)\n* [Creating ARM using Visual Define-XML Editor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PIxXMsBxzws&t=1490s), Basel SDE 2020 and CDISC San-Diego User Group meeting",
    "openSourceConsiderations": "VDE is published under AGPL-3.0 license. The main reason to create an open-source solution is to build of a community of users and have a transparency of the application. Also it provides an ability to build the application on platforms which are not available to me as a developer, e.g., mac os.\nAnother reason to make it open-source is to develop more open-source packages related to our industry. Other open-source packages which are developed separately and used by VDE: [cla-wrapper](https://github.com/defineEditor/cla-wrapper), [xport-js](https://github.com/defineEditor/xport-js), [dataset-xml](https://github.com/defineEditor/dataset-xml).",
    "maintenanceModel": "The project has a stable and development branches. Issues can be reported either by GitHub, e-mail or Telegram channel.\nIssues in the stable version are fixed via hotfixes (the project uses git-flow approach), although de-facto the development version is far ahead of the stable version and now issues are fixed in the next development release.",
    "projectSize": "Using a T-shirt estimation the project size is large. It has been developed\nsince 2018 and a rough estimate is that it was spend more than a thousand hours\non the project.",
    "contributors": "Contributors must follow eslint rules specified in the .eslintrc file in the root folder.",
    "users": "The primary users of VDE are clinical programmers developing and reviewing\ndataset specifications. It is expected that VDE users know Define-XML and ARM\nstandards. There is no external training or documentation for the editor, help\ndocumentation for non-standard functionality is available within the editor.",
    "preRequisites": "The software is distributed for MS Windows (Windows 7 and above) and Linux systems. It was complied by one person on MacOS, but it is not supported on that platform as support requires to have a Mac.\nThe project can be used as is and does not require any feedback or communication.",
    "projectServiceOptions": "For the company where I am working, I performed in-house validation of the software.",
    "sponsors": "N.A.",
    "goalsObjectives": "The main goal is the usage by an industry, so that the community\ncan provide user feedback and develop plugins (interface is not exposed in the\ncurrent version).",
    "communications": "The interaction with users is organized via a Telegram channel and\na LinkedIn group. Where possible, it is promoted at conference.",
