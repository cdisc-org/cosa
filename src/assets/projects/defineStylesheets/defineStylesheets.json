  "detailedDescription": {
    "problem": "Define-XML is a standard developed by CDISC to support transmission of metadata for tabular datasets, such as SEND, SDTM, and ADaM datasets. This standard describes an XML format, which is used to create a Define-XML document containing all of the study metadata that has been modeled following a set of one or more CDISC model's IGs. One of the purposes of the Define-XML standard is to provide a specification for a machine-readable metadata and as a result it may be hard to read this document as a text. For this purpose, the XSLT language can be used to transform XML to a human readable format, like HTML. XSLT does not regulate the output format, but the stylesheet described in this project transforms XML to HTML which can be easily viewed in a browser.",
    "solution": "To provide Define-XML v2.x XSL stylesheets that can be used in the case of electronic submissions to regulatory agencies.\n\nThe stylesheets for version 2.1 are located in this <a href='https://github.com/lexjansen/define-xml-2.1-stylesheets' target='_blank'>Define-XML v2.1 Stylesheet</a>\nrepository whereas the stylesheets for 2.0 are located in <a href='https://github.com/lexjansen/define-xml-2.0-stylesheets' target='_blank'>Define-XML v2.0 Stylesheet</a>.",
