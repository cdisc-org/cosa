detailedDescription:
  problem: Read and write Dataset-JSON files
  solution: Read in Dataset-JSON files to R with appropriate metadata, and
    assemble the necessary metadata to generate a Dataset-JSON file and write it
    out.
  openSourceConsiderations: Want to eliminate the need for people to have to
    figure this out on their own, and have a single R based solution for
    organizations to use to read/write Dataset-JSON files
  maintenanceModel: Issues can be submitted per GitHub
  projectSize:
    Relatively small project for now - standard is very straightforward
    and needs to be maintained to support the standard
  contributors: Submit issues / pull requests via GitHub. Changes accepted or
    rejected by repository maintainers.
  userDetails: Basic R skills
  preRequisites: Install the package via CRAN
  projectServiceOptions: None
  sponsors: NA
  goalsObjectives:
    Aim to be the single and centralized R solution for reading and
    writing Dataset-JSON files
  communications:
    Aim to be part of pharmaverse, COSA, and communicate via our own
    organizations. Package website will continually be maintained to detail
    changes
