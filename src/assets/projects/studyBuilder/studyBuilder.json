    "problem": "The current solutions for managing clinical data standards and study design specifications are often characterised by:\n\n*\tResource demanding double work\n*\tParallel work done in silos resulting in discrepancies and need for rework \n*\tMany handovers between different professional groups introducing lag-time\n*\tMany IT systems and tools\n*\tError-prone and resource intense manual steps \n*\tExpensive system maintenance and integration\n  \nAdditionally, the current CDISC standards have gaps in standards metadata, limiting automation opportunities. The inherent flexibility provided by the standards supports a broad range of implementations, but that flexibility also allows for inconsistencies that makes automation scaling difficult. Furthermore, the lack of end-to-end awareness and use of the CDISC standards (e.g. for writing documents such as the protocol and clinical study reports) prohibits efficient end-to-end automation and introduces discrepancies between different presentations of the study specifications, such as e.g. discrepancies in terminology used between protocol, CRF and SDTM datasets.       \n\nThe vision is to solve this problem by implementing standards as linked metadata with a conceptual foundation providing the additional semantics needed to support metadata driven-automation across the end-to-end clinical research data lifecycle – as illustrated by the CDISC 360 PoC project (see more at [https://www.cdisc.org/cdisc-360](https://www.cdisc.org/cdisc-360)).",
    "solution": "The StudyBuilder is a new approach to working with studies that once fully implemented will drive end-to-end consistency and more efficient processes - all the way from protocol development and CRF design - to creation of datasets, analysis, reporting, submission to health authorities and public disclosure of study information.\n\nThe StudyBuilder contains:\n\n* Standards and templates used for study specification\n* Individual versioning of standard elements in the library \n* Real-time team collaboration around study design by study team\n* Central storage of study design data for multiple down-stream usages (‘one source of truth’)\n* Versioning and full audit trail of study definitions\n\nThe StudyBuilder will cover the following study specification elements:\n\n* Study purpose (objectives, endpoints, estimands)\n* Population (disease area, indication, sex, age, etc)\n* Selection criteria (eligibility, randomisation, dosing, treatment discontinuation, etc)\n* Study type (interventional, observational, etc)\n* Study design (randomisation, blinding, arms, etc)\n* Interventions (drug, dose, route, devise, lifestyle interventions, etc.)\n* Visit schedule (naming, timing, type, windows)\n* Activities and assessments (what, how, when)\n* All the terminology and syntax standards to follow\n* Complete audit trail of what has changed over time\n  \nThe StudyBuilder consists of:\n\n* the StudyBuilder app (web-based user interface)\n* the new clinical Metadata Repository (central repository for all study specification data)\n* the API layer (allowing interoperability with other systems)\n* the integrations to source and target systems\n  \nThe conceptual design for the StudyBuilder system with connected system integrations is illustrated in the following diagram.\n\n![Diagram of conceptual design](./studyBuilderDesign.png)\n\n* **StudyBuilder** Documentation Online documentation for the StudyBuilder solution including introduction, user guides, system documentation and data model documentation.\n* **StudyBuilder App** Vutify based Web application with the UI for creating the study definition specification.\n* **Protocol Metadata add-in** Microsoft Word add-in tool holding the Protocol Template and import features of the structured study specification metadata that relates to the protocol content.\n* **Up-stream integrations** Integrations to up-stream clinical systems like CTMS, Trial Supplies, EDC, Study Registries, etc.\n* **Down-stream integrations** Integrations to down-stream clinical data systems for SDTM, ADaM, analysis and reporting.\n* **Explore data** FAIR based study search and explore tool utilising the StudyBuilder metadata with reference to systems holding study data.\n* **StudyBuilder API** and Standards Library API Python based web application based on FAST API framework supporting all CRUD actions to the database, access control, versioning, workflows and data integrity rules.\n* **Integration Service** Integration to UNIX based Statistical Computing Environment (SCE) with SAS and R.\n* **Clinical MDR** Neo4j linked graph database and data model supporting the library standards, study definitions including fine granularity of versioning, audit trail, workflows and access control.\n* **Standards Management** Integrated into the StudyBuilder App as the Library module managing concepts, dictionaries, code lists, syntax templates, project and TA standards.",
    "openSourceConsiderations": "This challenge cannot be solved by CDISC, any vendors or any pharma companies alone. The purpose of this project as an open-source project is therefore to engage interested stakeholders in the CDISC community to collaborate in funding, implementing, and applying this solution approach in our clinical development activities. We thereby hope the learnings and best practises can be shared in the community and be used in the coming development of the standard concepts, data models and API specifications.\n\nThe StudyBuilder system component architecture including software components and packages are illustrated in the following diagram.\n\n![Diagram of component design](./studyBuilderComponents.png)\n\nCore components will be shared under MIT and applications will be shared under the GPLv3 copyleft license. The Clinical MDR and StudyBuilder system consist of the following components under the following open-source licenses.\n\nSystem Component (License) | Technology (Git repository) | Description\n-- | -- | --\nStudyBuilder App (GPLv3) | Vue.js using Vuetify library (studybuilder) | JavaScript based web application with the UI for creating the study definition specification, maintaining library standards.

    "users": "Depending on the usage, different knowledge would be recommended. As a study designer you can setup a study very intuitively using the StudyBuilder and the available online help.\n\nAs a standards developer maintaining the concept-based data standards within the library areas more comprehensive training and use of online documentation is needed. \n\nWhen additional custom standards and models should be included into the biomedical concept model, linked data knowledge as well as knowledge about the Neo4j database would be recommended. This will be related to system maintenance. ",
    "preRequisites": "The current implementation required CDISC library access to access CDISC standards, a Neo4j database license for the database and a set of servers where the web applications and API services can run.\n\nNovo Nordisk is using a full containerised DevOps pipeline running in Azure where everything is hosted in the cloud. We will provide guidance on how a similar dedicated cloud-based environment can be made for stakeholders looking for a similar environment.\n\nAccess to a cloud-based sandbox or a dedicated evaluation environment can be provided by Neo4j free of charge. Please check out the community page for contact information on this option.\n\nIt is also possible to run the full system on a local desktop environment or on an individual cloud subscription on any of the main cloud providers. Instructions on how this can be done is made within the readme files in the Git repositories.\n\nThe different components can also be used independently due to the modular implementation and API usages.",
    "sponsors": "The project is currently funded by Novo Nordisk. Additional pharma companies who would be interested in funding additional development, modules or connected tools are be very appreciated and welcome.",
    "goalsObjectives": "The vision and business benefit of the solution is to support digitalisation in clinical development by:\n\n* IT enabling seamless interoperability and cross-functional end-to-end study-team collaboration.\n* Central storage of study design data for multiple down-stream usages (‘one source of truth’).\n* Save time and resources and minimise errors and discrepancies by enabling an end-to-end process based on shared standards, templates and study design data with the community to facilitate faster reporting and submissions.\n* Enable insights via enhanced search and explore.\n* Sustainable model for maintenance and integrations.\n* Solution based on industry standards with objective to drive this as a collaborative open-source solution.\n  \n**End-to-end process support**\n\nThe end-to-end process is supported by the use of new concept-based data standards from protocol set-up, study specification, clinical systems setup, and preparation of submission data deliverable. The StudyBuilder application supports study specification tasks for Trial Management, Clinical Reporting, Data Management and Biostatistics.\n\n**Benefits**\n\nThe benefits are to manage master data and definitions for CDISC Data Standards, other industry standards and internal standards. Furthermore, the clinical system set-up and end-to-end data integrations with higher degree of automation from study outline to submission are supported.\n\n**Innovation**\n\nA modern graph database is used with linking between related elements within and across standards (code lists) and studies. A transparent API-based architecture ensures simple system integration and allows for additional expanding via dedicated applications. A simple and intuitive user interface is used which is based on a state-of-the-art modern application framework.\n\n**Modular implementation**\n\nThe tool and interface design specifically supports partial components. A full-stack operational flow is not required. It is possible to use only parts of the tool set. The design allows for system replacements, for example when a component should be replaced with another technology considering the API interfaces. According the design additional tools and functionalities can be implemented using and providing APIs.",
    "communications": "A project community is built up. Pease check out the community homepage for up-to-date information about the project. The project is presented at various conferences. Special webinars, discussion and training sessions are planned. ",
    "additonalInformation": "**Background**\n\nThis solution is based on a legacy bespoke MDR system at Novo Nordisk, and one of the goals for Novo Nordisk is to ensure that our current sponsor defined data standards and portfolio of study definitions can be migrated into the new MDR and StudyBuilder system.\n\nThe new solution design for the StudyBuilder is deeply inspired by the CDISC 360 PoC project as well as the TransCelerate BioPharma Digital Data Flow (DDF) project. The goal for this project initiative is therefore to continue the collaboration with these initiatives and as the data model and API standards mature to ensure this open project solution becomes a compliant solution for these standards. Furthermore, additional community involvement is appreciated.\n\nCurrently the StudyBuilder solution is only sponsored by Novo Nordisk. Novo Nordisk seeks additional stakeholders that would be interested in co-sponsoring this open-source project.\n\nCurrently the first minimal viable product release is planned to be used by Novo Nordisk from Q1 2022."
