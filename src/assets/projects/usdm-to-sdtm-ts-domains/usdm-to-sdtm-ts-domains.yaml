detailedDescription:
  problem: >-
    The information stored in the USDM can be directly used for creation of the
    SDTM trial summary domains. 

    The mappings from USDM to SDTM trial design domains are available in the USDM/DDF Github. However, these need some more processing to be able to be used by a system.
  solution: We have converted the available SDTM mappings to jsonata commands.
    These commands are read by the python open source tool provided in the
    github and based on an USDM json file, result in the corresponding data
    items. In case of data arrays (like objectives, endpoints and
    interventions), the data is transformed in multiple rows for the output. All
    information is read from an excel input and written to an excel output
    readily available for programmers to be reviewed and included in their
    submissions.
  openSourceConsiderations: The solution is open source under the MIT license. the
    licenses of used functionalities need to be taken into account as well.
  maintenanceModel: Issues can be reported to our general info@clinline.eu E-mail address.
  projectSize: The project is relatively small (about 2-3 weeks) and is based on
    the USDM mapping experience of Berber (part of the USDM dev team).
    Transforming this into jsonata and checking whether it the jsonata lines are
    correct based on (adjusted) test USDM files is most of the work. The python
    code reading the jsonata code and writing the output to Excel is fairly
    simple.
  contributors: issue/change requests, code contributions and request
  userDetails: implementors, (clinical) programmers
  preRequisites: the input and corresponding mapping is available in github and
    can be adjusted based on preferences. Required python packages like for
    reading/writing to Excel and running jsonata are described in the readme
    file.
  projectServiceOptions: implementation services and additional feature building.
  sponsors: The project is sponsored by ClinLine providing the time/effort to
    build and maintain the tool.
  goalsObjectives: The goal is to provide a tool that creates the full set of SDTM
    trial summary domains based on the USDM.
  communications: ClinLine newsletters, linkedIn and CDISC 360i project
