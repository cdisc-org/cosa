  "detailedDescription": {
    "problem": "Many pharamceutical and biotech organizations are exploring the use of the R language for medical research and drug development.  While R has been used successfully to perform analysis, create datasets, and for reporting, there were no tools in R to create a Define-XML. Early R adopters reported that they could create everything needed for a drug submission in R, except for the Define-XML.  The motivation behind the defineR package is to fill that gap, and publish an open-source R package capable of generating the Define-XML.",
    "solution": "The defineR package is an easy-to-use R language package for generating Define-XML documents. It uses spreadsheet-based metadata. \n  \nThe spreadsheet metadata is passed into a function in the defineR package, which then generates the Define-XML and associated files.  \n\nThe defineR package can generate Define-XML documents for both SDTM and ADaM dataset standards.  \n\nThe package can identify and report on errors in the metadata.  It will check the generated XML against the Define-XML schema published by CDISC, and report any discrepancies. It will also use the Define XSLT transformation published by CDISC to generate the Define-HTML document. Reviewing the generated HTML can help you further refine your metadata, and confirm that the Define-XML is ready for submission.\n\ndefineR functions interact with the RStudio IDE to create an interactive experience. The discrepancy report is sent directly to the RStudio viewer, so you can instantly see any problems in your metadata.  The same discrepancy report is sent to the  output directory, as a permanent record of the success or failure of the run.  \n\nThe package is platform-independent. It will work on Windows, Unix/Linux, and Mac.  It has been tested with all R versions 3.6 and greater.  \n\nCurrently, the package produces only Define-XML 2.0 documents.  Support for 2.1 is planned for 2023.  \n\nThe template for the defineR metadata was taken from the book Implementing CDISC Using SAS An End-to-End Guide, Revised Second Edition by Chris Holland and Jack Shostak, and was published by SAS Institute in 2019.
