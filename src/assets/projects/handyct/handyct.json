  "detailedDescription": {
    "problem": "1. Extracting/reviewing information about control terminologies requires an extra efforts with  conventional methods such as download excel/pdf CT files, and search the specific control terminologies is not very efficient method. \n2. Maintaining multiple control terminologies with various version and at different published dates for each standards, can be complex and challenging for sponsors. \n3. Creating a single consolidated excel/pdf file for multi-version, multi-standards control terminologies can be  challenging with data sourcing, consolidating, distributing and maintaining each quarter for sponsors. 4. For consumers/end users, it requires an extra time and efforts to find correct control terminology  in critical timelines from the consolidated files.",
    "solution": "Integrating CDISC API with R Shiny webframe work, above mentioned problems can be resolved using point and click web application where user can easily access control terminologies  with limited steps and a very little effort. This modern way to access information comes  with high efficiency overall. This also resolve problem for sponsors as it is a single place for  combining and distributing control terminologies information for end users. This solution is  highly scalable where multiple standards and products can be added such SDTM and ADaM variables based on data availability.",
    "openSourceConsiderations": "Source of data is CDISC API (CDISC library), considering this should be open source.",
    "projectSize": "Currently this is a small size project/prototype. This project can be further extended  by adding sponsor's control terminologies with CDISC API and turn in to large project.",
    "contributors": "Currently this project is created as prototype, once it is enough stable will evaluate business needs and  add more contributors if needed.",
    "users": "R programming, Shiny webframe work, API data wrangling knowledge will be helpful to implement this project.",
    "preRequisites": "CDISC API, R packages(httr, tidyverse, rshiny, jsonlite, DT, Shinydashboard etc.), R-studio, Postman",

    "goalsObjectives": "Innovation and simplicity is primary objective of this project where control terminologies can be access with limited efforts and with out downloading excel/pdf etc. repetitively.",
