detailedDescription:
  problem: Display in a browser any well-formed ODM-XML file as a CRF rendition,
    complete with Title Page, Visit Matrix, TOC, CRF pages, or complete CRF
    book. Suitable for creation of acrf.pdf and bcrf.pdf submission documents
    without manual relocation of SDTM annotations on acrf.pdf, and no more
    extraction of CRF page numbers for define-xml origins
  solution: Apply the style sheet to the ODM-XML, exactly as you apply a style
    sheet to define-xml to display it in a browser
