detailedDescription:
  problem: No industry standard solution exists for developing ADaM, so each company repeats this effort
  solution: To provide an open source, modularized toolbox that enables the pharmaceutical programming community to collaboratively develop ADaM datasets in R
  openSourceConsiderations: We have a contribution model (https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiral/articles/contribution_model.html) and are looking into TA-specific package extensions
  maintenanceModel: See https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiral/articles/git_usage.html
  projectSize: Extra-large given 20 companies are now engaged via either contributing to development or testing the package
  contributors: See https://pharmaverse.github.io/admiral/articles/contribution_model.html
  userDetails: Purposefully made the package simple enough for any users to use once they read through our documentation, assuming they have basic knowledge of ADaM standards and R
