  "detailedDescription": {
    "problem": "Odmlib provides an easy way for Python programmers to create or process ODM and Define-XML documents. Make it simple to generate or process ODM or any ODM extension.",
    "solution": "Odmlib is a Python ODM library that simplifies creating and processing ODM and its extensions.\nThe odmlib package provides and object-oriented approach to working with ODM.\nIt also makes it easy for implementers to create tools that support their own ODM extensions without needed to create or process XML directly.\nIt serializes ODM as XML or JSON.\n\nIf you want to see a simple example program that shows how to create a simple ODM file using odmlib, check this out:\n[https://gist.github.com/swhume/ef8ca0385a706c344eec83dac34a1359](https://github.com/swhume/odmlib)",
    "openSourceConsiderations": "The odmlib package is open source to encourage programmers to build their own tools and to do cool things with ODM and its extensions.\nFor those that have similar interests, to consider improving the library. To encourage others to create and use open source applications.\nTo help grow the community of folks using ODM and its extensions.\n\nThe odmlib package uses the MIT license.\nIt has been independently produced as a library that scratches my personal itch to have an object-oriented library for working with ODM and its extensions.\nWe plan to use odmlib at CDISC to generate ODM and Define-XML content from the Library.\n\nThe odmlib repository is on my GitHub site [https://github.com/swhume/odmlib](https://github.com/swhume/odmlib).\nThe odmlib is under development.\n\nExample code to help programmers get started with odmlib is available at [github](https://github.com/swhume/odmlib_examples).",
    "maintenanceModel": "I plan to author blog posts to share odmlib with a broad audience.\nI plan to share the blog posts on LinkedIn.\nI will also share odmlib and its example applications with CDISC staff and others that have an interest in ODM.\nIf there's sufficient interest, I will highlight odmlib in conference presentations and possibly at a future hackathon.",
    "projectSize": "Large",
    "contributors": "As the primary author, I have been the main user of this new ODM library.\nCDISC will likely use this library to produce its ODM service for the CDISC Library.\nAs an ODM team lead, I will share odmlib with other ODM experts.\nSince it makes it easy for Python programmers to work with ODM, I hope this library appeals to other Python developers.\n\nAfter ODM v2.0 has been released as a draft, an ODM v2.0 model will be included as part of the odmlib package.",
    "userDetails": "As a new project that is just about to be released, it's too early to comment on the community or users.\nPersonally, if odmlib makes it easier for me and CDISC staff to create ODM solutions I will consider the project a success.\nIf other developers also find it useful that would be even better.\n\nThe odmlib package was originally developed by Sam Hume as a personal project.\nIt is not a CDISC project, but others in CDISC may use it and be contributing authors.",
    "preRequisites": "Follow getting started [instructions](https://swhume.github.io/odmlib/#getting-started).",
    "projectServiceOptions": "",
    "sponsors": "N.A.",
    "goalsObjectives": "The odmlib Python library will be the only general purpose Python package that I'm aware of for creating ODM tools.\nIt will work with ODM, its extensions, as well as allow developers to create software tools that support their own extensions.\nIt also makes it much simpler to produce or process ODM documents.\nPublished under the MIT license, I hope others that find it useful will contribute to it.",
