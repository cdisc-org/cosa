   "detailedDescription": {
      "problem": "Dataset-JSON (https://www.cdisc.org/dataset-json) is a proposed\nreplacement for the SAS Version 5 XPORT as an alternative transport format\nfor regulatory submissions. This project provides support for reading,\nwriting, and validating Dataset-JSON files in a SAS environment.",
      "solution": "The Dataset-JSON SAS Implementation has the capability to convert SAS datasets to and from Dataset-JSON files. It supports providing metadata through Define-XML. It can also compare libraries with SAS datasets to support round-tripping validation. It includes a Python script for validating Dataset-JSON files against the schema.\n",
      "openSourceConsiderations": "SAS itself is not Open Source. The main reason to\ncreate an open-source solution is to have a SAS application available that\nsupports Dataset-JSON and have transparency of the application.",

      "users": "The primary users of are SAS programmers creating and reading\nDataset-JSON files. There is no external training for the code.\nDocumentation for is available within the repository in the form of a paper,\nslides, and example programs.",
      "preRequisites": "The project has been test on Windows 10 with SAS 9.4 (TS1M7). The\ncode is also known to work on SASÂ® OnDemand for Academics.",
