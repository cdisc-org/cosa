detailedDescription:
  problem: Dataset-JSON (https://www.cdisc.org/dataset-json) is a proposed
    replacement for the SAS Version 5 XPORT as an alternative transport format
    for regulatory submissions. This project provides support for reading,
    writing, and validating Dataset-JSON files in a SAS environment.
  solution: >
    The Dataset-JSON SAS Implementation has the capability to convert SAS
    datasets to and from Dataset-JSON files. It supports providing metadata
    through Define-XML. It can also compare libraries with SAS datasets to
    support round-tripping validation. It includes a Python script for
    validating Dataset-JSON files against the schema.
  openSourceConsiderations: SAS itself is not Open Source. The main reason to
    create an open-source solution is to have a SAS application available that
    supports Dataset-JSON and have transparency of the application.
  maintenanceModel: >
    Issues can be reported either by GitHub
    (https://github.com/lexjansen/dataset-json-sas/issues) or by e-mail.
  projectSize: Medium
  contributors: Contributions should not have errors, warnings or significant
    notes that indicate issues in the LOG file.
  userDetails: The primary users of are SAS programmers creating and reading
    Dataset-JSON files. There is no external training for the code.
    Documentation for is available within the repository in the form of a paper,
    slides, and example programs.
  preRequisites:
    The project has been test on Windows 10 with SAS 9.4 (TS1M7). The
    code is also known to work on SASÂ® OnDemand for Academics.

  goalsObjectives: The main goal is providing support for the emerging
    dataset-JSON submission format, so that the community has a SAS based tool
    that can be used for testing Dataset-JSON and can provide user feedback.
  communications: Presentations at webinars and conferences.
