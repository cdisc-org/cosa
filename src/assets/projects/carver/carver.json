  "detailedDescription": {
    "problem": "Clinical reports used in submissions are still predominantly developed using SAS; with few specifications being common across the industry. Also, while reviewing outputs, minor changes may be required which currently involves an extra step where the programmer needs to write new code. This project aims to increase efficiency and reduce risk of errors by allowing for this with minimal manual intervention and repetitive processes and also to encourage more industry-wide standards for clinical analysis reporting.",
    "solution": "carver is an R package that helps develop Tables and Figures from CDISC-standard ADaM datasets. It provides an R Shiny framework to generate these reports interactively. Users can drill-down to the patient-level, interact with the data and plots, download QC datasets and save reports. While the application can act as a comprehensive, centralized web platform, it also allows for different companies to customize it to their requirements as it is built on re-usable modules.",
    "openSourceConsiderations": "This project built under Apache-2.0 License will be available for users across the industry, allowing for contributions. This will help to standardize generation of commonly used clinical reports in R.",
    "maintenanceModel": "The project has a protected stable branch and development branches. Issues can be reported in github. Issues in the stable version will be fixed via hotfixes and reflected in subsequent development releases.",
    "projectSize": "The current size of the project is L. Estimated time taken to develop the code-base was over 500 hours.",
    "contributors": "Contributors must adhere to the code of conduct described within the project: https://github.com/pfizer-opensource/carver/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md",
    "userDetails": "The users of this package are clinical programmers, clinicians or statisticians. They are required to have knowledge of CDISC standards and basic R skills. Help and instructional documentation is available within the package.",
    "preRequisites": "The package can be used within a stable R server or local installation. It can be used with Windows, Linux and macOS.",
    "projectServiceOptions": "None.",
    "sponsors": "Pfizer Inc",
    "goalsObjectives": "The goal is to expand the package beyond its current status to cover several submission-ready reports (safety and efficacy), both as standalone code and within a Shiny application.",
    "communications": "The project will be promoted at conferences when possible, and contributors can interact via Github.",
