  "detailedDescription": {
    "problem": "ODM-XML and Define-XML are usually seen as outputs, documenting the CRF and the study data. But they can also be regarded as specifications of the same items, produced by MDR tools at trial setup. Applying the macros (relying on the XMLMAPs) makes these XML documents machine readable in SAS. This in turn opens up a whole lot of opportunities for validating and correlating ODM and Define XML documents in SAS. One example supplied, is a SAS macro to align a master (standard) define.xml with a study specific ODM-XML, stripping unused datasets and variables (respecting mandatory items) and adjusting Controlled Terminology to the specifics of the study CRF",
    "solution": "An XMLMAP for each of ODM-XML and Define-xml. A small set of SAS macros for each, converting the XML documents to SAS datasets folowing familliar data models shared by MDR and validation tools",
