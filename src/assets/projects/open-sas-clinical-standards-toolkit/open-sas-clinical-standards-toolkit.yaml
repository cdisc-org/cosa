detailedDescription:
  problem: 'There is a need for SAS programmers to have a framework that allows
    for the registration of CDISC standards metadata to enable automation, such
    as working in SAS with XML based standards (Define-XML, ODM, ...) and
    validation of clinical data. '
  solution: >-
    The open-source release of SAS Clinical Standards Toolkit (openCST) is a framework to support
    clinical research activities. OpenCST focuses on the registration and use of
    standards defined by CDISC. The openCST framework is designed to support the
    specification and use of any user-defined standard. Originally developed by
    SAS it is now available as an open source resource. Examples of current
    functionality include:

    - creating/reading Define-XML v2.0

    - creating/reading Define-XML v2.1

    - creating/reading Dataset-XML

    - creating/reading ODM v3

    - creating/reading CT-XML

    - registration of CDASH, SDTM, SEND and ADaM metadata
  openSourceConsiderations: CST has been published as Open Source to support
    Community development and continued use by supporting new standards.
