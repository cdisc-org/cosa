Use OpenStudyBuilder to drive EDC setup - a COSA Workshop

<br/>

The workshop will primarily concentrate on the integration aspects of EDC (Electronic Data Capture) systems with OpenStudyBuilder, which boasts highly accessible interfaces through APIs and/or via ODM.XML file based integrations. Participants will gain insights into what currently would work and identify existing gaps, considering each system coming along with their own operational data model.

<br/>

We will start by explaining the OpenStudyBuilder vision around the end to end process with the illustration of the OSB Biomedical Concept (OSB BC). This will illustrate the Library and the Studies areas of the OpenStudyBuilder, and the reason for having every CTs, models and dictionaries connected to the metadata of our studies.We will here present the CRF module in the Library and explain the specification around the Study level, throught the use of the OSB BC.Then, we will split into different breakout groups with the following focus:

<br/>

* **Breakout 1** - EDC API based Integration: Working with standard CRFs (Case Report Forms), study SoA (Schedule of Activities) and vendor extensions in OpenStudyBuilder connecting to the EDC tools for EDC setup with bidirectional API based connections
* **Breakout 2** - EDC ODM.XML based Integrations: Same as above, but focused on file based ODM.XML integrations.
