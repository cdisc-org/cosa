### About

The Hackathon is an opportunity to collaborate with others from the CDISC Community to create open-source tools that operationalize the ARS Logical Model.

Participants will leverage metadata, analysis results, and displays as we work together to develop solutions that enhance the interoperability and reusability of analysis results data. We will create, ingest and process metadata specs as well as generate display outputs.

It is our hope that solutions resulting from the Hackathon can seamlessly integrate with existing analysis programs and report creation tools, enabling end-to-end automation of the analysis and reporting process. Our vision for the future state of analysis results reporting is a world where analysis results are machine-readable, easily navigable, and highly reusable.
