COSA has hosted a free workshop focusing on the OpenStudyBuilder at the 2022 European Interchange.  
<br/>
The OpenStudyBuilder is an open-source project for clinical study specification. This tool is a new approach for working with studies that once fully implemented will drive end-to-end consistency and more efficient processes - all the way from protocol development and CRF design - to creation of datasets, analysis, reporting, submission to health authorities and public disclosure of study information.  
<br/>
At this workshop the following was presented
* Why you should consider to use the OpenStudyBuilder solution
* Why we share OpenStudyBuilder as an open source project
* Why you should consider to contribute to the OpenStudyBuilder solution  

The following breakout groups has been discussing various aspects:

* Use OpenStudyBuilder to make study specification for structured protocol content
* Use OpenStudyBuilder to make study specification for CRF and data collection
* Use OpenStudyBuilder to make study specification for SDTM Study Design datasets
* Use OpenStudyBuilder to manage concept-based standards, ideate on BC definitions & Use NeoDash reports for status reporting on study specifications, Ideate on format and meta-checks
* How to start evaluate and use OpenStudyBuilder, deployment options, system operations and integrations & Demonstrate DDF API adaptor and discuss DDF API alignment
* Ideate on business opportunities for vendor services for OpenStudyBuilder
