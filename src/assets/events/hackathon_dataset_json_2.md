### About

Our first Dataset-JSON Hackathon was a success, providing [21 solutions](https://cosa.cdisc.org/hackathons/datasetJson) that use Dataset-JSON.

We look forward to similar success with Dataset-JSON Hackathon II.  Unlike the first hackathon, participants in Hackathon II will work together as a team. The outcome will be a draft API specification for Dataset-JSON. The team will receive a starter set of use cases, which they will refine and extend. Once the team completes the API specification, CDISC will release it for comment.

### Objectives
- Primary objective: Create a draft API specification for Dataset-JSON
- Secondary objective: Develop proof-of-concept implementations to demonstrate and test the API specification

### Key Dates
- Kickoff: 31 Aug 2023
- Virtual Hackathon: 1 Sep â€“ 19 Oct 2023
