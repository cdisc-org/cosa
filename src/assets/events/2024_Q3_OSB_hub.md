COSA introduces new collaboration teams! The OpenStudyBuilder Hub is one of the first teams!

<br/>

Join our OSB-Hub kick-off meeting where we introduce the OSB trail for controlled terminology! The OpenStudyBuilder Hub (OSB-Hub) is a collaboration team under the umbrella of the CDISC Open Source Alliance (COSA). Our mission is to support the utilization and enhancement of the OpenStudyBuilder open-source tool. Here, we not only collect valuable feedback and use-cases but also actively run focused projects. Join us to drive innovation forward through both community engagement and project execution.
